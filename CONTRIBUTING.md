# How to contribute

## Making changes

* Make sure your code complies with [Java code conventions from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html)
  * Line length is an exception, you can use 120 symbols per line instead of 80 as described by Oracle.
  * Don not use tabs for indentation at all, this is another exception.
  * You can check if code complies with project conventions using command `mvn site`.
  * 2 spaces should be used for XML and FXML code indentation.
  * Avoid empty lines in `pom.xml` file.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Commit messages should be in the imperative present tense, e.g. "Add README file"
